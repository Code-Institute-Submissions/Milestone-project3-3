# Feminist Book Site

This site is the Milestone Project 3 for the Software Development 
Diploma course at Code Institute. The project is aimed at displaying
my understanding of Python, micro-framework Flask and MongoDB for
building the back-end functionality for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update
Delete) website.

A live version of the website can be viewed here.

The main purpose of this website is to provide a collection of feminist books
to facilitate the interested reader in finding a book in this genre that he or 
she wants to read - and by doing so also spreading this literature to more readers. 
Through the functionality of adding, editing and deleting books, the site is meant to 
be a living fora for the reader to share their thoughts and reflections on different books. 
The possibility of sharing book-tips with others works as a motivator for reading and thus 
learning and discovering by exploring new books. In this way, the site aims both to increase
the reading of feminist literature and to build a sense of community around the reading.
To further add to this, a future functionality to add to the site could be some kind
of discussion board for sharing thoughts directly with each other, or to organize 
book clubs and read and discuss together in person or virtually.
